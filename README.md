# Todo-List :page_with_curl:

Created a to-do list webpage using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

User can use the following features:
  1) Add tasks to their to do list
  2) Set tasks as complete or uncomplete
  3) Delete tasks
  4) Filter through tasks list

The todo list is saved on local storage, thus data is still saved when the webpage is refreshed.
